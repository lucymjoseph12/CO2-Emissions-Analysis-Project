# CO2 Emissions Analysis

In this project, I tried to analyze the CO2 and Greenhouse Gases Emissions dataset provided by *Our World in Data* using Python packages like Pandas, Numpy and Plotly for visualization. To view the plotly graphs in the notebook, [click here](https://nbviewer.org/github/lucymjoseph12/Projects/blob/main/CO2%20Emissions%20Analysis/CO2%20Emissions%20Analysis.ipynb)

## Data

The descriptions for the columns used in this analysis are as follows:

* **country**              : Geographic location.	
* **year**                 : Year of observation.	
* **iso_code**             : ISO 3166-1 alpha-3, three-letter country codes.
* **co2**                  : Annual production-based emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), measured in million tonnes.
* **coal_co2**             : Annual production-based emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from coal, measured in million tonnes.
* **gas_co2**              : Annual production-based emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas, measured in million tonnes.
* **oil_co2**              : Annual production-based emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from oil, measured in million tonnes.
* **share_global_co2**     : Annual production-based emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), measured as a percentage of global       production-based emissions of CO2 in the same year.
* **share_global_cumulative_co2**: Cumulative production-based emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) since the first year of data availability, measured as a percentage of global cumulative production-based emissions of CO2 since the first year of data availability.
